(1,'Understanding Flexbox: Everything you need to know', 'Flexbox is a powerful layout module that allows you to create complex layouts with ease. It is a one-dimensional layout method that can handle both rows and columns, making it a versatile tool for designing responsive web pages. In this article, we will cover the basics of Flexbox, including its properties, how to use it, and some practical examples. Flexbox was introduced in CSS3 to improve upon the limitations of traditional layout methods like float and positioning. The main idea behind Flexbox is to provide a container that automatically arranges its children elements in a predictable way, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic. One of the core concepts of Flexbox is the flex container, which is an element with the display property set to flex. This container houses flex items, which are the direct children of the container. Flexbox offers several properties that control the layout and alignment of flex items within the container. Some of the key properties include flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap. The flex-direction property specifies the direction in which the flex items are placed within the container. It can be set to row, column, row-reverse, or column-reverse. The justify-content property aligns the flex items along the main axis, while the align-items property aligns them along the cross axis. Flex-wrap determines whether the flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or stay on a single line. Using these properties, you can create a wide range of layouts with minimal effort. For example, you can center elements both horizontally and vertically, create equal-width columns, or build complex grids. Flexbox also provides a flexible sizing model, allowing you to specify how much space each flex item should take up relative to its siblings. In addition to these core properties, Flexbox offers advanced features like nested flex containers, order property for rearranging items, and the ability to align individual items differently from the rest. By mastering Flexbox, you can create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices. Whether you are building a simple navigation bar or a complex web application, Flexbox is an essential tool for any web developer.', 1704103200000, 1704189600000, '/images/img1.jpg', 1),
(2, 'CSS Grid Layout: A Step-by-Step Guide', 'CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay out items in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of CSS Grid, providing examples and practical tips along the way. <br>CSS Grid is a layout model that enables the creation of complex and flexible web page designs. Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional, CSS Grid is two-dimensional, meaning it can handle both rows and columns simultaneously. This makes it ideal for creating grid-based layouts that require precise control over the positioning and sizing of elements. One of the key features of CSS Grid is the grid container, which is an element with the display property set to grid. The grid container is divided into grid tracks, which are the rows and columns that make up the grid. <br>These tracks are defined using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties, respectively. Each track can be assigned a specific size or set to auto to adjust based on its content. CSS Grid also introduces the concept of grid items, which are the direct children of the grid container. These items can be placed within the grid using the grid-area property, which specifies the starting and ending row and column lines for each item. Alternatively, you can use the shorthand properties grid-row and grid-column to define the position of grid items. One of the most powerful features of CSS Grid is the ability to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. This can be achieved using the fr unit, which represents a fraction of the available space within the grid. <br>By combining the fr unit with media queries, you can create grids that automatically adjust based on the viewport size. Another useful feature of CSS Grid is the ability to create gaps between grid items using the grid-gap property. This property allows you to specify the amount of space between rows and columns, making it easy to create visually appealing layouts with consistent spacing. CSS Grid also supports nested grids, where a grid item itself becomes a grid container. This enables the creation of complex, multi-level layouts that are easy to manage and maintain. By mastering CSS Grid, you can create flexible, responsive, and visually appealing web page designs that are easy to manage and maintain. Whether you are building a simple blog layout or a complex web application, CSS Grid is an essential tool for any web developer.', 1704276000000, 1704362400000, '/images/img2.jpg', 2),
(3, 'JavaScript ES6 Features: An Overview', 'ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced many new features to JavaScript. These include arrow functions, classes, template literals, let and const, default parameters, and more. This article provides an overview of these new features and how to use them in your JavaScript code. One of the most notable additions in ES6 is the introduction of arrow functions. <br>Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions, making your code more readable and maintainable. They also inherit the this value from the enclosing context, which can be useful when working with callbacks and event handlers. Another significant feature in ES6 is the introduction of classes. Classes provide a more straightforward syntax for creating constructor functions and working with prototypes. They also support inheritance, allowing you to create subclasses that extend the functionality of existing classes. Template literals are another powerful feature introduced in ES6. They allow you to create multi-line strings and embed expressions using a backtick (`) syntax. This makes it easier to work with dynamic content and construct complex strings without the need for concatenation. ES6 also introduces new variable declaration keywords: let and const. The let keyword allows you to declare block-scoped variables, which are only accessible within the block they are defined. <br>This helps to avoid issues with variable hoisting and improves the readability of your code. The const keyword, on the other hand, is used to declare constants, which are variables that cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. Default parameters are another useful addition in ES6. They allow you to specify default values for function parameters, making your functions more flexible and easier to work with. If no argument is provided for a parameter with a default value, the default value will be used instead. ES6 also introduces the spread and rest operators. The spread operator (...) allows you to spread the elements of an array or object into a new array or object, making it easier to work with collections of data. The rest operator, which uses the same syntax, allows you to collect multiple function arguments into a single array. <br>Promises are another significant feature introduced in ES6. Promises provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API. They allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together and handle errors more effectively. ES6 also includes many other features and improvements, such as the Map and Set data structures, new methods for arrays and strings, and enhancements to the Math and Number objects. By mastering these new features, you can write more efficient, readable, and maintainable JavaScript code, making your development process more enjoyable and productive.', 1704448800000, 1704535200000, '/images//images/img3.jpg', 3),
(4, 'A Comprehensive Guide to HTML5', 'HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. It introduces new elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the new features of HTML5 and how they can be used to create more interactive and dynamic web pages. One of the most significant changes in HTML5 is the introduction of new semantic elements. These elements provide more meaningful structure to your web pages, making them easier to understand and navigate for both users and search engines. Some of the new semantic elements include header, footer, article, section, and nav. These elements help to define the different parts of a web page, making it clear what each section is for. Another important feature of HTML5 is the support for multimedia elements. <br>HTML5 introduces the audio and video elements, which allow you to embed multimedia content directly into your web pages without the need for external plugins like Flash. These elements provide a more consistent and accessible way to include multimedia content on your website. HTML5 also includes new form elements and attributes that make it easier to create user-friendly forms. Some of the new form elements include date, time, email, and range input types. These elements provide built-in validation and user interface enhancements, making it easier for users to interact with your forms. The canvas element is another powerful feature of HTML5. The canvas element allows you to draw graphics and animations directly onto your web pages using JavaScript. <br>This makes it possible to create interactive and dynamic content, such as games, data visualizations, and custom user interfaces. HTML5 also introduces new APIs that provide enhanced functionality for web applications. Some of the new APIs include the Geolocation API, which allows you to access the user s location, and the Web Storage API, which provides a more secure and flexible way to store data on the client side. Another important aspect of HTML5 is its focus on accessibility. HTML5 includes new attributes and elements that improve the accessibility of web content for users with disabilities. For example, the role attribute allows you to define the purpose of an element, making it easier for screen readers to interpret the content. HTML5 also supports the use of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which provide additional information about the structure and behavior of web content. <br>By using these attributes, you can create web pages that are more accessible and usable for all users. In addition to these new features, HTML5 also includes many other improvements and enhancements, such as better support for mobile devices, improved performance, and enhanced security. By mastering the new features of HTML5, you can create more interactive, dynamic, and accessible web pages that provide a better user experience for your visitors.', 1704621600000, 1704708000000, '/images/img4.jpg', 4),
(5, 'Building Responsive Websites with Bootstrap', 'Bootstrap is a popular framework for building responsive websites. It includes a variety of CSS and JavaScript components that make it easy to create responsive, mobile-first web pages. This article will guide you through the process of building a responsive website using Bootstrap.<br> Bootstrap was developed by Twitter and released as an open-source project in 2011. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used front-end frameworks for web development. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed components and utilities that make it easy to create responsive layouts and user interfaces. One of the core features of Bootstrap is its grid system. The grid system allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts by dividing the page into a series of rows and columns. The grid system is based on a 12-column layout, which means you can create layouts that span from 1 to 12 columns. This makes it easy to create complex and flexible designs that adapt to different screen sizes. <br>In addition to the grid system, Bootstrap includes a variety of CSS components that can be used to style your web pages. These components include navigation bars, buttons, forms, cards, and more. Each component is designed to be responsive and can be easily customized using CSS classes. Bootstrap also includes a set of JavaScript plugins that add interactivity to your web pages. These plugins include modals, tooltips, carousels, and more. <br>The JavaScript plugins are built on top of jQuery, making them easy to integrate into your existing codebase. One of the main advantages of using Bootstrap is its mobile-first approach. This means that the framework is designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices, ensuring that your web pages look and function correctly on smaller screens. The responsive design principles built into Bootstrap make it easy to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

(6, 'Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript', 'Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to execute tasks in the background without blocking the main thread. This is essential for building responsive web applications. In this article, we will explore various ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, and async/await. Asynchronous programming is a key concept in modern web development. It allows you to perform tasks such as fetching data from an API, reading files, or performing complex calculations without freezing the user interface. <br><br>This is achieved by running these tasks in the background, allowing the main thread to continue executing other code. One of the earliest methods for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript is the use of callbacks. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed once the asynchronous operation is complete. While callbacks are a simple and effective way to handle asynchronous tasks, they can lead to callback hell, a situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain. To address the limitations of callbacks, JavaScript introduced promises in ES6.<br><br> A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations, allowing you to chain multiple operations together and handle errors more effectively. A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a promise is created, it is initially in the pending state. Once the asynchronous operation is complete, the promise is either fulfilled (if the operation was successful) or rejected (if an error occurred). You can use the then() method to specify what should happen when the promise is fulfilled, and the catch() method to handle any errors. Another significant advancement in asynchronous programming is the introduction of async/await in ES8. Async/await is built on top of promises and provides a more readable and synchronous-like syntax for writing asynchronous code.<br><br>The async keyword is used to define a function that returns a promise, while the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved. This allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain. In addition to these core concepts, there are several other techniques and libraries available for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. For example, you can use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests and handle the responses asynchronously. The Fetch API returns a promise, making it easy to integrate with other asynchronous code. <br><br>Another popular library for managing asynchronous operations is RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript). RxJS provides a powerful and flexible way to handle asynchronous events and data streams using observables. Observables allow you to work with asynchronous data in a declarative manner, making it easier to compose and manage complex asynchronous workflows. By understanding and mastering these techniques, you can build more responsive and performant web applications that provide a better user experience.', 1704967200000, 1705053600000, '/images/img6.jpg', 1),

Its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support make it an ideal choice for data science. In this article, we will explore how to master Python for data science, covering essential libraries, tools, and best practices. Python has become the de facto language for data science due to its robust ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Some of the most popular libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.<br><br> These libraries provide powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, making it easier to work with large datasets and extract valuable insights. NumPy is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions. NumPy s array-based data structures enable efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets, making it a critical tool for data scientists. Pandas is another essential library for data science. It builds on top of NumPy and provides data structures and functions specifically designed for data analysis. The core data structures in Pandas are Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional), which allow you to work with structured data in a flexible and efficient manner.<br><br> Pandas also includes a variety of tools for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation, making it easier to prepare your data for analysis. Data visualization is a crucial aspect of data science, and Matplotlib is the go-to library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib provides a wide range of plotting functions and customization options, allowing you to create informative and visually appealing charts and graphs. For more advanced visualizations, you can use libraries like Seaborn, which is built on top of Matplotlib and provides higher-level interfaces for creating complex visualizations.

(8, 'A Guide to React Hooks', 'React Hooks provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become a fundamental part of React development. This article will guide you through the basics of React Hooks, including how to use them, common hooks, and best practices. One of the most important hooks in React is the useState hook. The useState hook allows you to add state to functional components. <br><br>It returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update the state. By calling useState with an initial value, you can create a piece of state that persists across renders. Another essential hook is the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM. It takes a function as its argument, which is executed after every render. You can also pass a second argument, an array of dependencies, to control when the effect runs. <br><br>The useContext hook is used to access the value of a React context. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. By using the useContext hook, you can access the context value directly from a functional component. The useReducer hook is another powerful hook that can be used for state management. It is similar to useState but is more suitable for managing complex state logic. The useReducer hook takes a reducer function and an initial state as its arguments and returns the current state and a dispatch function. <br><br>The dispatch function can be used to send actions to the reducer, which updates the state based on the action type and payload. Custom hooks are a way to extract and reuse logic from functional components. By creating a custom hook, you can encapsulate common logic and share it across multiple components. Custom hooks follow the same rules as regular hooks and can use other hooks inside them. React also provides several other hooks, such as useRef, useMemo, and useCallback, which can be used for specific use cases. The useRef hook allows you to create a mutable ref object that persists across renders. The useMemo hook is used to memoize expensive calculations, and the useCallback hook is used to memoize functions. When using hooks, it is important to follow the rules of hooks to avoid common pitfalls. The rules of hooks state that hooks should only be called at the top level of a component and not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. <br><br>This ensures that hooks are called in the same order on every render, preserving the state and behavior of the component. By mastering React Hooks, you can write more concise and maintainable code, reducing the need for class components and simplifying state management. Hooks provide a powerful way to leverage the full potential of functional components, making it easier to build complex and interactive user interfaces in React.', 1705312800000, 1705399200000, '/images/img8.jpg', 3),
(9, 'Introduction to Node.js', 'Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling you to build scalable and high-performance web applications. In this article, we will explore the basics of Node.js, including its architecture, key features, and common use cases. One of the main advantages of Node.js is its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This means that Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for one request to complete before starting the next. This makes Node.js particularly well-suited for building real-time applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and live streaming. <br><br>Node.js uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations. The event loop continuously checks for new events and executes the corresponding callbacks. This allows Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable applications. Another key feature of Node.js is its single-threaded nature. Unlike traditional multi-threaded server architectures, Node.js uses a single thread to handle all incoming requests. This simplifies the development process and reduces the risk of concurrency issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks. Node.js also provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules through its package manager, npm. Npm is the largest package registry in the world, with over a million packages available for download. These packages cover a wide range of functionalities, from web frameworks and database drivers to authentication and testing tools. One of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js is Express.js.

Overall, building scalable web applications requires a combination of architectural best practices, scalable infrastructure, efficient data management, fault tolerance, and performance optimization. By following these principles and strategies, developers can create web applications that can scale to meet the demands of growing traffic, data, and users.', 1710500400000, 1710586800000, '/images/img37.jpg', 2),

(38, 'Exploring WebAssembly', 'WebAssembly is a binary instruction format that enables high-performance execution of code on the web. It is designed to complement JavaScript and provide a more efficient and secure runtime environment for running web applications. WebAssembly allows developers to compile code written in languages such as C, C++, and Rust into a compact binary format that can be executed in web browsers at near-native speeds. In this article, we will explore WebAssembly, its key features, benefits, and use cases.<br><br>

One of the key features of WebAssembly is its performance. By providing a low-level, close-to-the-metal execution environment, WebAssembly enables web applications to achieve near-native performance, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks such as gaming, multimedia processing, and scientific simulations. WebAssembly leverages hardware capabilities such as multi-core processors, SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, and efficient memory management to optimize performance.<br><br>

WebAssembly is designed to be portable and platform-independent, allowing code compiled to WebAssembly to run consistently across different devices and architectures. This makes it easier for developers to build cross-platform web applications that work seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, without the need for platform-specific optimizations or modifications.<br><br>

Another key benefit of WebAssembly is its security. WebAssembly runs in a sandboxed environment within the web browser, providing a layer of isolation and protection against malicious code. It enforces strict security policies such as memory safety and type safety, preventing common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and code injection attacks.<br><br>

WebAssembly can be used in conjunction with JavaScript to enhance the capabilities of web applications. Developers can use WebAssembly to offload performance-critical tasks to optimized native code modules, while still using JavaScript for high-level application logic, user interface interactions, and DOM manipulation. This allows developers to leverage the strengths of both languages and create more efficient and responsive web applications.<br><br>

WebAssembly has a wide range of use cases across various domains, including gaming, multimedia, virtual reality, augmented reality, CAD (Computer-Aided Design), scientific computing, and more. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require high-performance computation, low-level access to hardware, or integration with existing native code libraries.<br><br>

In summary, WebAssembly is a powerful and versatile technology that enables high-performance execution of code on the web. Whether you`''`re building a web game, multimedia application, or scientific simulation, WebAssembly provides the performance, portability, and security needed to push the boundaries of what`''`s possible on the web.', 1710673200000, 1710759600000, '/images/img38.jpg', 3),

(39, 'A Guide to Software Testing', 'Software testing is a process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements and quality standards. It is an essential part of the software development lifecycle and helps identify defects, errors, and vulnerabilities early in the development process. Effective software testing ensures that the software meets the needs of users, functions as expected, and delivers a high-quality user experience. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to software testing, covering its key concepts, types, techniques, and best practices.<br><br>

Software testing involves various activities and techniques aimed at uncovering defects and ensuring the quality and reliability of software applications. Some of the key activities in software testing include:<br><br>

1. Test planning: Developing a test plan that outlines the objectives, scope, resources, and timeline for the testing process.<br>
2. Test design: Creating test cases and test scenarios based on the requirements and specifications of the software.<br>
3. Test execution: Running the test cases and executing the tests to verify the functionality and behavior of the software.<br>
4. Defect tracking: Identifying and documenting defects or issues discovered during testing and tracking their resolution.<br>
5. Test reporting: Generating test reports that summarize the results of the testing process, including test coverage, defect metrics, and quality metrics.<br><br>

Software testing can be broadly categorized into two main types: manual testing and automated testing. Manual testing involves human testers manually executing test cases and verifying the behavior of the software. It is suitable for exploratory testing, usability testing, and ad-hoc testing scenarios where human judgment and intuition are required. Automated testing involves using automated testing tools and scripts to execute test cases and validate the functionality of the software. It is suitable for regression testing, performance testing, and repetitive testing tasks that can be automated.<br><br>

There are various techniques and approaches to software testing, including:<br><br>

1. Black-box testing: Testing the functionality of the software without knowledge of its internal implementation.<br>
2. White-box testing: Testing the internal structure, logic, and code of the software to ensure completeness and correctness.<br>
3. Unit testing: Testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to verify their behavior and functionality.<br>
4. Integration testing: Testing the interaction and integration between different modules or components of the software.<br>
5. System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements and works as expected.<br>
6. Acceptance testing: Testing the software from the end user`''`s perspective to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations.<br><br>

Best practices for software testing include:<br><br>

1. Start testing early in the software development lifecycle to identify defects and issues as soon as possible.<br>
2. Develop clear and concise test cases that cover all aspects of the software`''`s functionality and behavior.<br>
3. Use a combination of manual and automated testing techniques to maximize test coverage and efficiency.<br>
4. Continuously monitor and update test cases to reflect changes in requirements, code, and functionality.<br>
5. Collaborate closely with developers, stakeholders, and end users to ensure that testing efforts align with business goals and user needs.<br><br>

Overall, software testing is a critical aspect of software development that ensures the quality, reliability, and performance of software applications. By following best practices and leveraging appropriate testing techniques and tools, organizations can deliver high-quality software products that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.', 1710846000000, 1710932400000, '/images/img39.jpg', 4),
(40, 'Understanding Continuous Integration', 'Continuous integration is a practice in software development where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, often multiple times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by building the project and running automated tests to detect and fix integration errors early in the development process. Continuous integration aims to improve the quality, efficiency, and speed of software development by promoting collaboration, early feedback, and rapid iteration. In this article, we will explore the concept of continuous integration, its benefits, principles, and best practices.<br><br>

Continuous integration (CI) is based on the principle of frequent integration of code changes into a shared codebase, combined with automated testing and verification to ensure that the software remains in a working state at all times. CI systems automatically build the project, run tests, and provide immediate feedback to developers about the status of their code changes, allowing them to detect and fix integration issues quickly and prevent regressions.<br><br>

One of the key benefits of continuous integration is improved software quality. By integrating code changes frequently and running automated tests, CI helps identify defects, errors, and inconsistencies early in the development process when they are easier and less costly to fix. This leads to fewer bugs, higher code quality, and a more stable and reliable software product.<br><br>

Continuous integration also promotes collaboration and communication among team members by providing a shared platform for integrating and testing code changes. CI systems provide visibility into the status of the codebase, allowing developers to see which changes have been integrated, which tests have passed or failed, and who made the changes. This encourages transparency, accountability, and teamwork within the development team.<br><br>

Another benefit of continuous integration is increased productivity and efficiency. By automating the build and test process, CI eliminates manual, repetitive tasks and reduces the time and effort required for integration and testing. This allows developers to focus on writing code and implementing features rather than troubleshooting integration issues or dealing with broken builds.<br><br>

Continuous integration follows several key principles and best practices, including:<br><br>

1. Maintain a single source code repository: Use a version control system like Git or SVN to store all code changes and ensure that developers are always working with the latest version of the codebase.<br>
2. Automate the build process: Use build automation tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI to automatically build the project and generate executable artifacts whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.<br>
3. Run automated tests: Implement a comprehensive suite of automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to validate the functionality and behavior of the software.<br>
4. Fix broken builds immediately: If a build or test fails, developers should prioritize fixing the issue and restoring the build to a working state as soon as possible to prevent integration problems.<br>
5. Monitor and analyze build metrics: Track key metrics such as build success rate, test coverage, build duration, and code quality metrics to identify areas for improvement and optimize the CI process.<br><br>

Overall, continuous integration is a foundational practice in modern software development that promotes collaboration, quality, and efficiency. By integrating code changes frequently, running automated tests, and providing immediate feedback, CI helps teams deliver high-quality software faster and with fewer defects.', 1711018800000, 1711105200000, '/images/img40.jpg', 5);
